*Prepared: October 24, 2025*

> This brief synthesizes **verifiable** evidence as of October 24, 2025. It is **not** an advocacy document. Where data are uncertain or limited, we say so explicitly.

## 1. Executive Summary
- What is known with high confidence.
- What is debated / uncertain.
- Immediate guardrails for protecting minors while research continues.

## 2. Background and Definitions
- DSM-5 definition of Gender Dysphoria (2013).
- Scope differences: social transition vs. medical interventions.
- Distinguish **legal recognition** from **clinical care**.

## 3. Evidence on Trends (2013–2025)
- Rising referrals: what multiple datasets show; note regional variation.
- Possible contributors (visibility, diagnostic changes, help-seeking).

## 4. Clinical Guidelines and Oversight
- WPATH SOC-8 (2022) — key adolescent guidance.
- Endocrine Society overview (if used).
- Cass Review (2024) — findings and implications.
- Nordic guidelines (Sweden 2022; Finland if cited).

## 5. Mental Health Outcomes
- Co-occurring conditions prevalence (anxiety, depression, neurodiversity).
- Short-term outcome signals vs. long-term gaps (>3–5 years).

## 6. Detransition/Regret and Follow-up
- What meta-analyses show (adult surgical outcomes).
- Limits of generalizing adult surgical data to youth/non-surgical contexts.
- The need for standardized follow-up.

## 7. Economic and Policy Context
- Where profits exist; what is **documented** vs. **speculated**.
- Funding transparency and the absence of audited links to curricula (as of today).

## 8. Ethical Guardrails and Recommendations
- Robust, multidisciplinary assessment; therapy-first for minors.
- Long-term outcome tracking requirements.
- Transparency (registries, audit trails, conflict-of-interest reporting).
- Protect detransitioners and families (consent, privacy).

## 9. Methods and Confidence Grading
- Source inclusion criteria (peer-reviewed, gov audits, SEC/990).
- A/B/C confidence rubric.

## 10. References
- Link each claim inline to primary sources from the Source Log (IDs 1–10 to start).
